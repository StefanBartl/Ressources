                                        It is made with Visual Studio Code, Chrome/Firefox, Git and GitHub on a Linux Ubuntu OS.
                                                    Thanks to all of the people which made that or working there.



                                                        A few words to the readers of the Javascript / CSS Files:
The code is - as you can see - sufficiently commented. For some programmers this might seem strange, but for me and my way of 
coding it is  extremely helpful. I like to use whitespace for formatting,  all classes start with Class_ and all id's with ID_  - and, 
i also describe    the individual processes with comments in as much detail as possible so that I can get back to work reliably and 
quickly after a while.    This makes working on projects for me a lot easier. I hope that this approach is also helpful for you.



                                                                          Specially about this work:
This is one of my very first works and I learned a lot programming it. My learning philosophy is very practically oriented: probably because
I am a skilled craftsman, I learn best when, after reading a topic, I immediately start implementing it and start a project and work on it 
until I have produced a good result. I can only give one recommendation to all those who find it difficult to deal with the often overwhelming
            amount  of programming learning material: Go ahead and implement it! Even if not everything will work from the beginning,
                                if you are persistent and don't give up, you will learn quickly.

At the beginning of this project I thought of a maximum of one week that I will work on it. It's been almost 4 weeks now. :-)
